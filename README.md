# Project Tracey

A markdown-based requirements tool for creating and updating trace links between structured requirements and source code.

## Workflow

- Document the project requirements in markdown files
- Each requirement is assigned a unique ID in the markdown frontmatter
- Annotate the requirement ID in the source code
- Run `tracey` to generate the trace links

For more information have a look a the [Getting Started](./docs/getting-started.md) guide. If you are interested in how the generated trace links look, have a look at [a real requirements document of this project](./requirements/Requirement/TraceabilityTable/Update.md).

## Contributing

I develop this project for my master studies and I might get in trouble because of code ownership if I accept pull requests. Therefore, pull request will not be accepted until I have finished my master studies. After that, pull requests will be accepted.
