# Updating Requirements

Requirements are updated according to the existing trace links.
The update process has the following rules:

-   A table containing trace links is added if there are trace links
-   An existing table of trace links is updated if the trace links have updated
-   An existing table of trace links is removed if the the trace links do not exist anymore
