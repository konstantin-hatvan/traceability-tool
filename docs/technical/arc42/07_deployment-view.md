Tracey is developed locally and pushed to a global public git repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/konstantin-hatvan/traceability-tool). From there, a deployment pipeline is triggered for building the package and publishing it to the global public [npm registry](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tracey-cli). Users can then install the package locally.
