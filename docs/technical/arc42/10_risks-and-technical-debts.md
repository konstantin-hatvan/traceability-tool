# Risks and Technical Debts

| ID     | Description                                                                                                     | Priority | Actions                                                                                                                |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| -------- | -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| RISK_1 | Low user acceptance. Software is not used. Time was wasted                                                      | HIGH     | Utilize user-centered development approach. Make software incrementally adoptable                                      |
| RISK_2 | Ill-defined project boundaries. Stakeholders have secret expectations                                           | HIGH     | Clearly define project requirements and project boundaries. Communicate those boundaries to stakeholders               |
| RISK_4 | Fragile project architecture. Software hard to maintain or extend. Software needs refactoring                   | MIDDLE   | Find a robust solution. Use a test driven development approach. Precisely document architectural decisions             |
