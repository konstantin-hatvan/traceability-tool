## Ideas

Klaus Feiler suggested another plugin for tracey. The plugin shall allow connecting requirements to JIRA Issue by using the Issue ID in the metadata. The plugin should then generate a link to the JIRA Issue. This is also the first step to add more possible integrations with JIRA.

- I plan on continuing with the master thesis.
- I plan to create the final presentation
