# Week 52

Current release [v0.1.0](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tracey-cli/v/0.1.0)

## Activities / Actual progress

### Master Thesis

I continued writing for the master thesis.

### Research Question Refinement

I came up with a candidate for a suitable research question:

`How can a text-based documentation format be utilized to create a requirements traceability tool that supports agile processes?`

In my opinion this is so far the best candidate since it perfectly fits the master project while still offering a scientific contribution. Additionally, it is already very narrowed down to the subject. The lack of boundaries and focus on a subject matter was one of the main drawbacks of other candidates and made it hard to progress with the master thesis.

Feedback of the academic supervisor is currently gathered.
