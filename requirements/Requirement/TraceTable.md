# Trace Table

-   The program generates a table containing the tracelinks
-   Each row consists of a relative link, a line number and a description
-   Tracelinks are transformed to relative links
-   Relative links between requirement files and source files contain the line number
-   Relative links between other files do not contain the line number

<div class="tracey">
